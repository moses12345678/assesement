The goal of this interview is to see if you can find relevant resources to help you complete the 2 following tasks.

1. Python

Write a function that returns the file extension if it exists.

Function implementation in [coding.py](./python/coding.py)
Test cases in [coding_test.py](./python/coding_test.py)

2.  Javascript

Implement getProducts function in [App.svelte](./products/src/App.svelte) to fetch the data from https://dummyjson.com/products to display it in the sample app.

Extract the product display section of the view into a Svelte component [Product.svelte](./products/src/lib/Product.svelte).

In the Product component, add functionality to display the price and rating. Add a toggle button with the text 'show details' that will change to 'hide details' when the price and rating are shown. See [video](./show-details.mp4)
